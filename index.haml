        %p
          I am a UI Developer with many years of experience building powerful web applications. My primary passion throughout my career has been front-end development, but my versatile skills have made me an asset across all areas of web programming.
        %p
          In addition to software development, I also have a strong interest in human language, and I am slowly working towards becoming a hobby Linguist.

          %h2 Front-end
          :markdown
            I am an expert in writing web interfaces using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, but I have recently fallen in love with [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). I am also particularly interested in creating interfaces that utilize new features in modern browsers without sacrificing usability and functionality in other browsers.

          %h2 Back-end
          :markdown
            My primary server-side strength is as a [Perl](http://perl.org) developer, but I am always eager to learn new languages. I am very comfortable using several flavours of unix and am also very competent with relational databases, particularly [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/).

          %h2 Personal
          %p I am easygoing and enjoy working with people, both in person and remotely. I have plenty of experience pair-programming, but I also find it easy to work on projects solo. I am approachable and I always welcome constructive criticism. I am also eager to learn new skills and absorb information from colleagues and friends.

          %h2 Development Methodologies
          :markdown
            I have been a member of teams that have used a wide variety of agile development methodologies. At Sophos, I was introduced to agile in the form of scrum and later Industrial XP. At Socialtext, we were faced with the added challenge of adapting agile development practices (particularly [Kanban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)) to a distributed development structure.

          :markdown
            I am enthusiastic about the Open Data movement and its ability to empower citizens. Along with two friends, I co-founded the web site VanTrash.ca in 2009, which used data from the [City of Vancouver's Open Data Catalogue](http://data.vancouver.ca) to provide a notification service that helps citizens remember when to take the garbage and recycling out. Our app won the People's Choice award in the [Apps 4 Climate Action](http://www.livesmartbc.ca/A4CA/gallery.html) contest in 2010. We have since renamed the service [Recollect.net](http://recollect.net) and have expanded to more than 20 municipalities across Canada.
