        %p
          I am a UI Developer with many years of experience building powerful web applications. My primary passion throughout my career has been front-end development, but my versatile skills have made me an asset across all areas of web programming.
        %p
          In addition to software development, I also have a strong interest in human language, and I am slowly working towards becoming a hobby Linguist.

          %h2 User Interface Development
          :markdown
            I am an expert in writing web interfaces using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, but I have recently fallen in love with [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/) and [Less](http://lesscss.org/). I am also particularly interested in creating interfaces that utilize new features in modern browsers without sacrificing usability and functionality in the older browsers. I have also written mobile applications for iPhone, Android, and Blackberry 10.

          %h2 Server-side Development
          :markdown
            My primary server-side background is as a [Perl](http://perl.org) developer, but I am also proficient in using other languages such as C, C++, C#, Java, etc., and I am always eager to learn new ones. I currently prefer to write server-side applications in JavaScript or CoffeeScript using [node.js](http://nodejs.org).  I am very comfortable using several flavours of unix and a variety of relational databases, particularly [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/).

          %h2 Personal
          %p I am easygoing and enjoy working with people, both in person and remotely. I have plenty of experience pair-programming and enjoy the obvious benefits of working together on problems, but I am also comfortable working on projects solo. I believe I am approachable and always welcome constructive criticism. I enjoy helping colleagues learn new skills, and likewise, I am also eager to absorb new information and skills from them. Finally, although I may appear quiet in large groups, I am excellent at communicating and working with my peers.

          %h2 Development Methodologies
          :markdown
            I have been a member of teams that have used a wide variety of agile development methodologies. At [Sophos](http://sophos.com), I was introduced to agile in the form of scrum and later Industrial XP. At [Socialtext](http://socialtext.com), we were faced with the added challenge of adapting agile development practices (particularly [Kanban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)) to a distributed development structure.
